# ANTICIPATING NOTIFICATIONS FROM THE BUS

I'M TALKING ABOUT OF ANTICIPATING INSDE SERVICE

NEED TO SET UP HANDLER WHO WILL HANDLE NOTIFICATIONS SENT FROM THE BUS

LIKE I SAID, ONLY EVENT BUS WILL HIT THOSE ROUTES

## ANTICIPATING NOTIFICATIONS INSIDE POSTS SERVICE

- `code posts/index.js`

```js

```

I JUST CONSOLE LOGED STUFF FOR NOW

## ANTICIPATING NOTIFICATIONS INSIDE COMMENTS SERVICE

- `code comments/index.js`

```js

```

SAME THING HERE I JUST CONSOLE LOG STUFF FOR NOW

THAT'S BECAUSE I WANT TO TEST THS BEFORE I CONTINUE

## TESTING ALL /events ROUTES

- `yarn start`

- `cd posts/` `yarn start`

- `cd comments/` `yarn start`

- `cd event_bus` `yarn start`

NOW TRY TO CREATE POST AND LOOK AT TERMINAL TERMINALS OF POSTS AND COMMENTS SERVICES

SAME THING FOR CREATING COMMENT
