# STORING EVENTS WHEN THEY HIT EVENT BUS

IF OUR SERVICE ISN'T WORKING FOR A LONG TIME WE KNOW THAT WITH MICROSERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE, ONE CRACHED SERVICE WON'T CRACH ENTIRE APP

BUT WHEN SERVICE IS DOWN FOR SOME TIME (SHORT OR LONG), WE SHOUD HAVE MECHANISM FOR HIM TO GET ALL THE EVENTS THAT WERE HAPPENING WHEN HE WAS DOWN
