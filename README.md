# EVENT BUS OVERVIEW

BUILDING EVENT BUS FROM SKRATCH

WILLL BE USING expressjs

I WON'T BE USING SOLUTIONS FOR EVENT BUS LIKE:

<https://www.rabbitmq.com/>

<https://kafka.apache.org/intro>

<https://nats.io/>

COMMON THING BETWEEN ALL THIS TYPES OF BUSES IS THAT THEY RECEIVE EVENTS AN THEN THEY WILL PUBLISH THEM OUT TO LISTENERS

EVENTS ARE SO PIECE OF DATA (IT CAN BE JSON, RAW BYTES OF DATA, STRING, ANYTHING ...)

## WHEN USING TERMS LISTENERS WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT SERVICES ANTICEPATING EVENT SENT FROM EVENT BUS

# CODE TO BE ADDED TO PROJECT

POSTS AND COMMENTS SERVICE WILL HAVE `/events` ROUTE

THEY WILL ANTICEPATE EVENTS FROM BUS (POST REQUEST)

ALSO NEW SERVICE, A QUERY SERVICE WILL ALSO HAVE THE SAME THING

**ALSO, EVENT BUS WILL HVE SAME ROUTE: `/events`, AND IT WILL ANTICAPATE NETWORK REQUEST (EVENTS FROM SERVICES)** (POST REQUEST)

EVENT BUS WILL BE PLIN EXPRESS APPLICATION

HE ANTICAPATES POST REQUEST (ANTICAPATES EVENT FROM SERVICE)

**AND THEN EVENT BUS WILL SENT SERIES OF POST REQUESTS BACK TO ALL SERVICES (DATA IS SENT WITH EVENTS, OR YOU CAN CALL THEM NOTIFICATIONS)** (TO THE /events ROUTE)

## THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION LIKE I SAID

WHEN YOU BUILT PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION THERE WILLL BE MORE TO IT, OFCOURS IN TERMS OF EVENT BUS
