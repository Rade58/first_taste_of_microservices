# ADDING A NEW FEATURE

IDEA IS TO ADD A NEW FEATURE THAT WILL DO A COMMENT MODERATION

FOR EXAMPLE, IF A COMMENT HAS A WORD, FOR EXAMPLE 'foobar',COMMENT SHOULD BE FLAGED AS REJECCTED

YES YOU CAN IMPLEMENT THAT IN FRONTEND BUT THAT IS NOT IDEA; IDEA IS TO CREATE ANOTHER SERVICE

WHEN IT COMES TO FRONTEND, POST SHOULD HAVE INFO ABOUT IS COMMENT `rejected`, IS IT `approved` OR IS IT `pending`

SO COMMENT DOCUMENT SHOULD HAVE MAYBE `status` FIELD WITH MENTIONED POSSIBLE VALUES

**AT FIRST GLANCE THIS LOOKS SIMPLE BUT AS YOU PROGRESS YOU WILL SE THAT IS NOT SO SIMPLE**

IN MONOLIT WORLD THIS WOULD BE EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM

# YOU CAN TAKE FEW APPROCHES

LETS SEE WHAT THEY ARE AND AT THE END WE WILL PICK ONE

### 1) MODERETION SERVICE WOULD EMMIT EVENT IF SOMETHING IF FLGGED AS rejected OR approvedd OR pending; AND THAT WOULD BE ANTICEPATED BY THE QUERY SERVICE

BUT FIRST, QUERY SERVICE SHOULD STOP CARING IF COMMENT IS CREATED

TYPE OF "CommentCreated" SHOULD BE ANTICEPATED BY THE MODERATION SERVICE

AND WHEN MODERATION SERVICE APROVES OR REJECTS, EVENT COMMENT APROVED OR COMMENT REJECTED SHOULD BE EMITTED (OR JUST "CommentModerated" WITH ADDITIONAL status PAYLOAD THAT HAS approved OR rejected)

AND THEN QUERY SERVICE SHOULD CATCH THAT, AND DO THE THIG IT IS ALREADY DOING

BUT THIS IS BAD BECAUSE OF THE THIRD status AND THAT IS pending

**MODERATION STTUS CAN BE TIED TO MODERATOR WORK, AND IF SOMEONE DIDN'T DO A MODERATION, NOTHING WOULD GET TO THE QUERY SERVICE FOR A LONG TIME**

AND WE DON'T WANT THAT BLOCKING IN THE FLOW, BECAUSE THAT'S BAD FOR USER EXPERIANCE

AFTER SUBMITING COMMENT USER SHOULDN'T BE FORECED TO WAIT FOR TO SEE A COMMENT HE SHOULD AT LEAST SEE THAT HIS COMMENT IS SENDT SUCCESSFULY, AND THAT IT IS PENDING MOERATION

### 2) BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE THAT WE ENHANCE APPROACH ABOVE, WITH COMMENTS SERVICE EMITTING EVENT ANTICAPATED BY THE QUERY SERVICE WITH INDICATION THAT COMMENT IS PENDING

THAT'S HOW WE CAN DISPLAY SOMETHING IF COMMENT IS PENDING

AND MODERATION CAN BE WAITED; IT WILL EMIT "ModerationCompleted" EVENT WHEN IT IS FINISHED

BUT ALSO THIS IS NOT BEST SOLUTION IF YOU MAYBE PREDICT THAT YOU CAN HAVE MAYBE BUNCH OF DIFFRENT SERVICES THAT ARE PROCESSING COMMENT; MANY EVENTS YOU WOULD HAVE TO HANDLE INSIDE QUERY SERVICE; MAYBE UPVOTES EVENT OR DOWNVOTES EVENT OR COMMENT ADVERTISED, OR COMMENT PROMOTION, OR ANONYMOUS COMMENT

PROBLEM WOULD BE THAT QUERY SERVICE WOULD HAVE TO KNOW TOO MUCH OF THT

SO WE WILL DO THIRD APPROACH

### 3) COMMENT MODERATION, AND MAYBE SIMILAR POSSIBILE SERVICES (WHICH I DON'T HAVE IN THIS PROJECT) SHOULD EMMIT EVENTS TO THE COMMENTS SERVICE FIRST

FOR EXAMPLE "CommentCreated" GOES TO THE SERVICES SIMILAR TO MODERTION

BUT ALSO GOES TO QUERY SERVICE, SO THAT SHOWING OF SOMETHING TO THE USER IS BEING DONE RIGHT AWAY (THAT IS IMPORTATN LIKE I SAID)

BUT WHEN MODERATION FINISHES (OR SOME SERVICE SIMILAR TO MODERATION, A SERVICE THAT POSIBLY PROCESSES COMMENTS), AN EVENT CALLED "CommentModerated" SHOULD BE EMMITED FROM THAT SERVICE' SAME THING IF YOU HAVE MANY DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT PROCESS COMMENTS, THEY WOULS EMMIT SOMETHING LIKE "CommentLiked" OR "CommentPrivated"

SO NOW LIKE YOU SAW, A COMMENTS SERVICE WOULD ANTICAPATE THOSE COMMENT RELATED EVENT, THAT EVENT WHO WOULD PROCESS COMMENTS (NOT ANY OTHER SERVICE QUERY)

SO COMMENT SERVICE WOULD ANTICEPATE MENTIONED MODERATIO NSERVICE EVENT, AND IT IS GOING TO UPDATE COMMENTS

THEN GENERIC EVENT CALLED "CommentUpdated" SHOULD BE EMMITED FROM COMMENTS SERVICE (ALSO IF YOU HAVE BUSINESS LOGIC, THAT MEANS MANY OF SIMILAR SERVICES, YOU WOULD SEND A GENERIC "CommentUpdated" EVENT TOO) (YOU WANT TO AVOID SENDING ALL TYPES OF EVENTS LIKE "CommentModderated" "CommentLiked" "CommentPrivated"; YOU JUST WANT ONE GENERIC "CommentUpdated" EVENT)

**AND THAT WAY YOU DON'T NEED HADLING MANY COMMENTS RELATED EVENTS WITH DIFFERENT NAMES BY OTHER SERVICES WHO ARE NOT COMMENTS SERVICES** (THAT WOULD BE BAD IF YOU WOULD HAVE 20 SERVICES THAT PROCESSES COMMENTS (SO THAT WOULD BE 20 DIFFERENT EVENTS SENT DO QUERY SERVICE))

AND THEN ** `"CommentUpdated"`  WOULD ECHO TO QUERY SERVICE, AND QUERY SERVICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR STORING ALL POSTS AND COMMENTS, BUT ALSO LIKE YOU KNOW: SERVING EVERYTHING IN ONE REQUEST

MAKES SENSE

QUERY SERVICE DOESN'T CARE HOW COMMENTS ARE UPDATED, HE WOULD JUST TAKE THEM, AND UPDATE HIS DTABASE, AND ANTICAPATE RQUEST FROM FRONTEND

## IN NEXT BRANCH I WILL START IMPLEMENTIN OPTION NO 3
