# EVENT BUS OVERVIEW

BUILDING EVENT BUS FROM SKRATCH

WILLL BE USING expressjs

I WON'T BE USING SOLUTIONS FOR EVENT BUS LIKE:

<https://www.rabbitmq.com/>

<https://kafka.apache.org/intro>

<https://nats.io/>

COMMON THING BETWEEN ALL THIS TYPES OF BUSES IS THAT THEY RECEIVE EVENTS AN THEN THEY WILL PUBLISH THEM OUT TO LISTENERS

EVENTS ARE SO PIECE OF DATA (IT CAN BE JSON, RAW BYTES OF DATA, STRING, ANYTHING ...)

## WHEN USING TERMS LISTENERS WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT SERVICES ANTICEPATING EVENT SENT FROM EVENT BUS
