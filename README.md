# DEBUGGING




# WE CAN TEST THIS NOW

NOT THROUGH REACT APP (IN A SENSE THAT WE ARE NOT RENDERING ANYTHING BASED ON status)

BUT WE CAN START ALL SERVICES AND START A REACT APP AND THEN WE CAN MAKE FEW POST AND COMMENTS

**AND THEN WE CAN EXECUTE MANUAL TEST BY SENDING REQUEST WITH `httpie` TO QUERY SERVICE**

- `yarn start`

NEW TERMINAL

- `cd posts` `yarn start`

NEW TERMINAL

- `cd comments` `yarn start`

NEW TERMINAL

- `cd query` `yarn start`

NEW TERMINAL

- `cd moderation` `yarn start`

NEW TERMINAL

- `cd event_bus` `yarn start`

I MADE SOME POSTS AND COMMENTS (**IMPORTANT THING IS THAT SOME OF THE COMMENTS SHOUD HAVE WORD "`foobar`"**)

**GETTING ALL POSTS WITH httpie**

- `http GET :4002/posts`

# SOME PROBLEMS

I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE INCONSISENCIES

MAYBE I OVERLOOKED SOMETHING

OR PROBLEM IS BECAUSE I'M DOING STUFF IN MEMORY

**EVENT BUS IS FAILING FOR SOME REASON, MEYBE HE IS A PROBLEM**

TRIED TO REWRITE IT BUT I GAVE UP

I UNDERSTAND THE BASICS; AND THAT IS IMPORTANT

BUT TRYING TO DEBUG THIS EDUCATIONAL APP WOULD BE A BIG WASTE OF TIME

SO I WILL STOP HERE
