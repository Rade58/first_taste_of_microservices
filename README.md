# ADDING A NEW FEATURE

IDEA IS TO ADD A NEW FEATURE THAT WILL DO A COMMENT MODERATION

FOR EXAMPLE, IF A COMMENT HAS A WORD, FOR EXAMPLE 'foobar',COMMENT SHOULD BE FLAGED AS REJECCTED

YES YOU CAN IMPLEMENT THAT IN FRONTEND BUT THAT IS NOT IDEA; IDEA IS TO CREATE ANOTHER SERVICE

WHEN IT COMES TO FRONTEND, POST SHOULD HAVE INFO ABOUT IS COMMENT `rejected`, IS IT `approved` OR IS IT `pending`

SO COMMENT DOCUMENT SHOULD HAVE MAYBE `status` FIELD WITH MENTIONED POSSIBLE VALUES

**AT FIRST GLANCE THIS LOOKS SIMPLE BUT AS YOU PROGRESS YOU WILL SE THAT IS NOT SO SIMPLE**

IN MONOLIT WORLD THIS WOULD BE EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM
